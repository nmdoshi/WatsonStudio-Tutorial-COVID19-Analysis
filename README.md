# Business Case
Use of advance analytics to  predict covid cases in counties and apply optimization for emergency response
As mentioned in medium article, our goal is to build an intelligent inventory and distribution strategy for medical PPE using AI. We will work  on predicting future demand of our products to help us determine our optimal inventory level using SPSS Modeler for Watson Studio on IBM Cloud, use Data Refinery to understand the data and patterns and use IBM Decision Optimization(CPLEX) to provide recommendations on where government should be sourcing the equipment from . SPSS Modeler is a data mining and analytics software that is used to build predictive models and IBM Decision Optimization is prescriptive solution that enables decision makers to take action.

## Learning objectives
After completing this tutorial, the user will learn:

* How to upload data to IBM Watson Studio and understand the data
* How to use the SPSS tool to prepare and build predictive model within Watson Studio
* Build Optimization model using model builder within Watson Studio
